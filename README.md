# Wireless Indoor Localization through Machine Learning Techniques

With the recent explosion is internet of things devices the need for a cheap and reliablemethod to determine the location of WiFi connected devices has become a very popular researchtopic. There are a few methods that can be used to determine the locations of internet connecteddevices, until recently one of the most popular methods would have been to use GPS. However,using GPS comes with a few problems. For one, itâ€™s signal is not very strong indoors and can evenbe non existent underground, another issue is that GPS is not normally precise enough todetermine a location down to an individual room in a building. Another method to determine thelocation of WiFi connected devices is to use a the wireless signal strength itself. All devicesconnected to a wireless signal have a received signal strength indication or RSSI. Since wirelesssignal strength decays the farther a device is from its source (a WiFi router in this case) it shouldbe possible the use the RSSI as a measure of the distance from a router. And with the signalstrength measurements from multiple routers an actual location can be determined for the givendevice.
